This application is developed as part of the requirement for the **Coursera Data Science Capstone Project**. 

The goal of the project is to build a predictive text model combined with a shiny app UI that will predict the next word as the user types a sentence.

### How it works

1. Upon initial load up of the application, **Predicted next word** will be blank.

2. To begin the next word prediction, User may then enter a partially complete sentence in the input box given on the left side panel.

3. Next word predicted is shown at the **Predicted Next Word**.
